 *  IT Support
    Oh really? Could you fix my computer, it has an error.
 *  Janitorial Services
    Ah! You keep on cleaning those toilets. 
    That's where I spend most of my day!
 *  Accounting
    ~suspicion+=10
    I haven't seen you around the office, are you pulling my leg?
 *  mistype
    ~suspicion+=10
    Hmmm, okay...

- Did you hear Janet was caught with her hand in petty cash?
 *  Bad move!
    Crazy right? The first rule of stealing is don't get caught! 
    What can you expect from a silly blonde like that.
 *  Surely not Janet!
    ~suspicion-=5
    I know right? She seems like such a little sweetheart... 
    Guess the quiet ones are the naughtiest!

    Where have you been? 
    This is all everyone on the upper floors keeps talking about!

    ~suspicion+=10
    You good mate?

- Pretty cool right? My idea of course.
 * They suck
    ~suspicion+=10
    How dare you?! 
    Those forms are a bureaucratic masterpiece!
 * What forms?
    ~suspicion+=20
    Didn't you receive the newsletter update? Strange...
 * I love them to death!
    ~suspicion-=10
    Of course you do! Those forms are a piece of bureaucratic beauty!

 * Jerry?
   I don't know about that, Jerry's butt is very nicely shaped - not that I have been looking at it!
 * Butt?
   You heard me right son. Just pages and pages of a round, perky butt...
 *  mistype
    ~suspicion+=10  
    Are you feeling well love? You're slurring your words...

- I keep telling them that the best solution for these problems is to check everyone's butts!
 * Agreed!
    Ahahah! Someone that knows what's up!
 * Weird
    ~suspicion+=10 
    Is it? Don't people like butts?
 * Inappropriate...
    ~suspicion+=10 
    Oh, apologies, nobody's ever complained to my face...

 * Deserved!
    ~suspicion-=10
    Aw thank you sweetheart! 
    You know just what to say to melt this old lady's heart!
 * From what?
    ~suspicion+=10
    I'll have you know we are very busy down at HR! Cheeky!

    What do you mean? I'm Giles and my daddy is the boss of this company!
 * I'm not the driver
    Ugh that sucks! 
    A new hotdog skin just dropped and I have a bunch of VBucks burning a whole in my pocket!

- I could be ranking up in fortnite right now!
 * Fortnite?
    ~suspicion+=10
    You don't know Fortnite? Are you like a boomer or something?
 * What's your rank?
    I'm silver 3, I'm going to go pro for sure!
    Daddy is going to buy an e-sports team for my birthday!
 * Leave?
    ~suspicion+=10
    And walk home? Are you actually insane or just drunk?
 * Ask your dad?
    Don't you think I've thought of that? I can't find him anywhere!

- Also I demanded they get turkey quiches for today and there are none!
 * Quiches?
    ~suspicion+=10
    Of course you wouldn't know what a  quiche is. 
    A quiche is a... it's like a type of... well it doesn't matter!

 * Okay...
    Yeah, and you know, I already feel so helpful! 
    Everyone keeps asking me for the most random stuff, they really must like my work!
    The CEO even asked me to accompany his child to a gaming tournament once!
    That's trust right there!
 * Don't talk to me
    ~suspicion+=5
    Oh uh ok, is this like a hazing thing? 
    Everyone keeps telling me that ahaha....
 * Internship? Neat.
    Yes! Can you believe it? This company is amazing! 
    Such productive work. You really feel like you're changing things in the world... 
    You know... with the widgets we make and all... those are real helpful!

- Anyway, what department are you on? 
- Don't think I've seen your face around. 
- I'm good with faces you know?
 * Intern!

    Oh! What are your thoughts on the new tax forms? 
    Jerry keeps bragging about them. I hope one day I'll be able to do work like that.

    ~suspicion+=30
    Aahahah very funny sir! 
    Like someone would just walk in from the street and join a random party!

    I swear to god I can't wait to for this internship to be over and done with!
 * Interns multiplying
    Ahaha good one! 
    Trust me, I hate this more than you do.

- They're using us. We do all the grunt work, yet we get paid in pence?
- They even have me driving the CEO's son sometimes...
 * Quit

    Wow great advice! 
    Wouldn't be here if I didn't need the job.
 * Sucks to be you
    Ahahah funny! You should try stand up!
 * Complain
    ~suspicion+=10

    ~suspicion-=5
    Yeah! I think I WILL ask Tim, mighteven smell his breath, see if it smells like turkey
 * Crazy
    ~suspicion-=5
    Finally, someone that agrees with me! We deserve to be heard!

- They really thought having turkey mini quiches here would distract me from what really matters! Fools!
 * Mini quiches?
    Oh, I've eaten the last 20, my bad...
 * It matters?
    ~suspicion+=10
    We've been over this! You don't play with a man's food!
 * Corruption!
    ~suspicion-=10
    You're right! They think we can't fight back against this oppressive system!
    This goes all the way to the top!

    Blasphemy! I'll make a complaint to HR about this!
